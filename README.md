Used CNN deep learning technologies 
Made Sequential->Convolution->Avg pooling->Flatten layers for the classification that is based on resnet9 architecture
Evaluated it using sparse categorical loss function for back propagation,used accurcay,f-1 score and confusion matrix for evaluation
Used matplotlib a python library to compare the accuracy and loss output for the train and test set
